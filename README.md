# SJEP-Classifier
Strong Jumping Emerging Patterns (SJEP) Classifier 

This is the source for an implementation of the SJEP-Classifier method propossed in:

Fan, H., & Ramamohanarao, K. (2006). Fast discovery and the generalization of strong jumping emerging patterns for building compact and accurate classifiers. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 18(6), 721-737.

This method works with datasets in KEEL format only.
